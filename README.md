# Multi-Function-Digital-Clock-in-C-language

This program is to provide users with many features that can be useful in their daily lives. The first is a digital clock that can be personalized to the user's preferences and allows them to select a time zone, which may be useful for frequent travelers. The second tool is a stopwatch, which is useful for calculating how long something takes to make.  A timer with an alarm function is the third and last option.
